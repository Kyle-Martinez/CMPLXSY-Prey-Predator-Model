# CMPLXSY-Prey-Predator-Model

This NetLogo project models the interactions between predators (hyenas) and prey (buffaloes) in a simplified ecosystem. The simulation includes elements such as energy dynamics, reproduction cycles, agent detection, and grass regrowth as the food source for the prey. The primary aim is to explore the balance between predator and prey populations and the impact of environmental factors on their survival and reproduction.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- NetLogo 6.2.0 or higher. Download it from [the NetLogo website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

### Installing

1. Clone this repository or download the `.nlogo` file to your local machine.
2. Open NetLogo.
3. From the File menu, select 'Open...' and navigate to the downloaded `.nlogo` file.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.nlogo` file in NetLogo.
2. Press the 'setup' button to initialize the environment, predators, and prey.
3. Press the 'go' button to start the simulation. The simulation runs until one of the species goes extinct, or it reaches 500 ticks if the limit-ticks option is enabled.
4. Adjust model parameters (such as initial number of buffaloes and hyenas, energy levels, reproduction costs, and grass regrowth time) as needed to explore different scenarios.

## Built With

- [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) - The agent-based modeling platform used.
